# git instructions
- When creating a commit message that completes a feature, indicate in the message that you are resolving a github issue (if any) and which one it is.
- Use concise messages, that explains why something was done. Don't focus too much on the technical details. The diff will cover the details.
- Only create branches if asked to. Otherwise use main.
