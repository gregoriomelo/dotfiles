# Testing
- When creating e2e test, favor readability and reusability.
- Whenever building a new feature, create easy to run e2e tests.
- Ensure coverage is 100%. If technically impossible, let me know and we may consider lowering the coverage target.
- Create and run mutation tests as part of the pipeline so we make sure coverage makes sense.
- CI pipelines should always be there. Every new project starts with a pipepline, which can be run locally.
- Before considering a task is done, run the pipeline locally, especially the quick tests.
