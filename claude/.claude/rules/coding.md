# Coding
- Prefer immutable data structures, favor functional programming constructs
- Consider docker for running apps when applicable
- Focus on security awareness when producing code. Security is never an afterthought
- Be careful with db schema changes. Go interactive mode when schema changes may be necessary
- Use Context7 for most recent documentation, code samples and related information
- Adopt architectures that favor vertical thin slices of features.
